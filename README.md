Teach Robert basics of Python

## Using Git Features for Milestones:

1. Tags for Lesson Checkpoints:
   - After completing a lesson, tag the repository (e.g.,
     lesson-1-complete) so you can easily refer back or reset progress.
2. Branches for Challenges:
   - Create a branch for optional activities or challenges (e.g.,
     guessing-game-advanced) to demonstrate branching without requiring
     formal Git training.
3. Diffs for Feedback:
   - Use git diff to compare your son’s work to the lesson’s solution.
     It’s a great way to visualize changes and explain debugging in a
     constructive way.
4. Pull Requests for Collaboration:
   - When he’s ready, introduce simple pull requests. Even a
     one-sentence description like “This adds the birthday calculator
     program” builds good habits.
